# tracerract.github.io
Github page for my portfolio website.

Designed with the intent to showcase features and code I am confident working with, but also to be moderately practical for personal use.

One of the best ways to learn is to teach, so I intend to utilize this in the future to create a tutorial.

Implemented Features:
-Customized landing page
-Profile Links
-Navigation (No destinations available yet though)


Planned features:
-Domain uses personal domain
-Resume hosted with simple download button
-Project Section
  -Showcase several recent projects
  -Showcase most recent accomplishment
-About Section
  -Basic personal info
-JS to collapse sections and allow sections to be cycled instead of scrolled
-Turn site into PWA
  -Allows simple projects to become installed apps
  -Enables quick access to resume/profiles
