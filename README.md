Implemented Features:

    -Customized landing page
    -Profile Links
    -Navigation (No destinations available yet though)
    -Domain uses personal domain
    -Project Section
      -Showcase several recent projects
      -Showcase most recent accomplishment
    -About Section
      -Basic personal info
    -JS to collapse sections and allow sections to be cycled instead of scrolled
    -alternating themes based on which links are currently selected, i.e. github link or linkedin link


Planned features:

    -"My name is" sticker converted to SVG
    -More in depth examples of the themes after they are transitioned to
    -landing page is one main link that has it's text rearranged depending on which link is active
    -Drop out the freecodecamp cert project for something newer and more relevant
