# tracerract.github.io
Github page for my portfolio website.

Designed with the intent to showcase features and code I am confident working with, but also to be moderately practical for personal use.


Implemented Features:

    -Customized landing page
    -Profile Links
    -Navigation (No destinations available yet though)
    -Domain uses personal domain
    -Project Section
      -Showcase several recent projects
      -Showcase most recent accomplishment
    -About Section
      -Basic personal info
    -JS to collapse sections and allow sections to be cycled instead of scrolled


Planned features:

    -Update Portfolio to utilize React instead of pure JS
    -Add a feature for switching themes
